# epistemic_uncertainty_microscopy_image_classification
Quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of microscopy image classification using Bayesian Deep Learning.

To run this file, we recommend opening it in Google Colab and importing the data into the Drive. Then, in order to refer to the correct files, the file path can be changed to the path of the file in the drive (if needed). For computation purposes, we recommend running the code with GPU (change this in Colab by Runtime -> Change Runtime type).

For SMLM, the file path can be changed for the two musts, named "train_path", in the block under "Importing raw data". For the should (varying parameters), the file path "test_path", in the block under "Importing SMLM images for varying mean intensity" can be changed.

For EM, two paths can be changed for the two musts, named "train_path" and "test_path", in the block under "Importing raw data".
